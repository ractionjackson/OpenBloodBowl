# OpenBloodBowl

**OpenBloodBowl is a project I will be working on that is going to be a faithful representation of various Blood Bowl rulesets (customizable), drawing heavy inspiration from Cynanide's *Blood Bowl: Legendary Edition*. **

If Games Workshop (owners of 'Blood Bowl' IP which is based on the Warhammer universe) has a problem with the title of the project, it can be changed. I have lots of writings in notebooks of code and design diagrams for this, need to fetch them and then digitize and type code up.
